Burned Area Mapping: A geographical representation of the burned areas. The map could highlight burned regions, and users could select a date range to see the affected regions during that time.

Time-Series Analysis: Graphs could show the day-by-day or month-by-month progression of burned areas, helping identify trends and peak burning periods.

Vegetation Impact: Show the before-and-after state of vegetation in affected areas. This could also be evolved into a vegetation recovery tracker.

Burn Radius: A dashboard component that represents the spreading radius of each fire over time.

Fire Frequency: Show a count of the number of fires detected over time.

Comparative Analysis: Compare the burn data of different regions, different vegetation types, or the same location over different periods.
